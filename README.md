# Image Degradation Simulation Library

## Overview
This project aims to simulate various types of degradations commonly found in historical photographs and printed materials. The library provides modular, customizable methods for applying these degradations to images.

## Features
- **Halftoning Techniques**:
  - Atkinson dithering
  - Floyd-Steinberg dithering
  - Bayers threshold halftoning
  - Dot-based halftoning
- **Noise Addition**:
  - Gaussian noise
  - Salt-and-pepper noise
  - film grain
- **Paper Imperfections**:
  - ink bleed
  - paper crumpling effect
- **Pipeline Support**:
  - Combine multiple degradations into a single simulation pipeline.
